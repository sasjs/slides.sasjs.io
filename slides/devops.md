# Challenges with Traditional SAS Project

- Scattered Artefacts > _Hard to navigate - changes are lost_
- Shared Environment > _Edits affect everyone_
- Single Server >  _Migration Management_

<br>

ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ **The absence of a _standardised framework_ makes for _inconsistent project delivery_ and _on-boarding struggles_ for new developers**


<!--
For SAS 9 each dev could have a dedicated RACE image, harder with Viya though

Macros on filesystem, Code split between Jobs and Studio programs,

# SASjs Projects

- Push to Any or Many > _Server Agnostic_
- Centralised Artefacts > _Source Controlled_
- Isolated Developer Environments > _Move Fast and Break Things_

<br>

‚úÖ Highly suitable where SAS Programming is involved
‚ùå Needs additional work for graphical artefacts (VA, Flows etc)

---
# Why Do SAS Developers ‚ù§Ô∏è It?

 - Use preferred IDE > _VS Code / Sublime / Vim_
 - Access to the terminal > _Shell scripts, Python_
 - Access to local applications > _GIT GUI / Doxygen_

---
# Why Do SAS Admins ‚ù§Ô∏è It?

 - Nothing to install on the SAS server
 - No SSH or special permissions (server OR desktop)
 - Nothing to configure, except:
     - Optional: Access to the target folder
     - Optional: Client / Secret (Viya)
     - Optional: SAS 9 setting for encoded passwords

---
# Why Do Project Leads ‚ù§Ô∏è It?

 - Faster to on-board new developers
 - Ability to work on multiple features in parallel
 - Complete visibility of what is being developed

---

# Actual Deployments

- Department of Work & Pensions (with SAS UK)
- Lloyds List Intelligence (with SAS Belgium)
- SKR Association (with SAS Sweden)

<!-- Plus Data Controller for SAS -->

# What is SASjs?

1. An Opinionated Approach - _which led to the development of:_
2. A Collection of Tools
    - [@sasjs/cli](https://github.com/sasjs/cli) - CI/CD and Automated Deployment
    - [@sasjs/core](https://github.com/sasjs/core) - Macro library
    - [@sasjs/vscode-extension](https://github.com/sasjs/adapter) - Battery Pack for VS Code

<!-- optionated - working locally, git centric, server agnostic -->

## Compilation - Scaffolding Consistency

![vertical height:350](https://i.imgur.com/1rlvQzl.png)![vertical height:350 opacity:100%](https://media1.giphy.com/media/yoJC2HDpFMZArbGJnW/giphy.gif)![vertical height:350](https://i.imgur.com/GnXZglB.png)

---
## Compilation Components

_Targets are compiled by reference to the dependencies listed in the Doxygen header._

- Artefacts: **Jobs, Services, Tests**
- Dependencies: **Macros, Includes, Binary Files**
- Optional Frontend - convert a web project into a [streaming app](https://sasapps.io/blog/).

---
## SASjs Config File

Every SASjs Project has a `sasjs/sasjsconfig.json` file, for configuration of:

 - Location of Artefacts (+ Dependencies & Init/Term programs)
 - Macro Variables
 - Target attributes / connection settings

---
# SASjs Target

A location on a SAS server. Can be specific to individual developers, or shared location such as a release environment.

Core attributes:

 - `name` > Alias for SASjs commands, eg: `sasjs deploy -t dev3`
 - `serverUrl` > Protocol + Host + Port
 - `serverType` > either `SASVIYA`, `SAS9` or `SASJS`
 - `appLoc` > Root deployment folder in SAS Drive or Metadata

 Plus any target specific overrides - ie macro variables, artefact / dependency locations etc.
